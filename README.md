## Architecture

Ethers for interacting with Ethereum

Magic Link for Login + Signer

There's a few components that deal with the presentation layer + data

User balance, for Eth and ERC20 tokens is fetched through hooks, see /hooks

In order to fetch all ERC20 Balances at once I used: https://www.npmjs.com/~wbobeirne for
https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-balance-checker
